# Accessible Web Components

This repository will hold some small web components (not [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) ) that aim to be as accessible as possible out of the box.

Wherever possible, native HTML elements have been used to build more complex functional elements to benefit as much as possible from built-in browser accessibility.

I've used SASS to build the CSS, as all the components rely on some common elements (like general layout, colours, etc), so ensure you have SASS installed if you want to build locally.
